# aspnetCoreRESTapi

This is an example of creating an API using asp.net core.

When creating a Web Application using a template, there are different folders and files already created.

The files here are the main files that I worked with.

The Customer.cs is used as a model to interact with the database.

The CustomerController.cs is used to create an route to /displayCustomers where it will display the results in JSON format.

The HTTP Method GET is used.




Some of the other files already created that were modified include startup.cs for the endpoints.
